Automated Screw Tightening Machine (PLC-Controlled)

This project is an industrial automated screw tightening machine designed for consistent, reliable, and repeatable screw fastening in a production environment.
The system is built using PLC-based control, integrated with servo/driver systems, sensors, and safety components to ensure accurate torque control and stable operation.

The machine is suitable for electronics, mechanical assemblies, and industrial manufacturing, where precision and efficiency are critical.
